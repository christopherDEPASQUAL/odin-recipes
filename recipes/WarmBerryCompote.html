    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Warm Berry Compote is a delicious and easy-to-make dessert that is perfect for
        any occasion. It is made with fresh berries, sugar, and a touch of lemon juice,
        and can be served warm or cold. The compote is a great way to use up any
        leftover berries, and can be enjoyed on its own or with a dollop of whipped
        cream or ice cream.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 cup fresh berries (strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, etc )</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 lemon, juiced</li>
        <li>1/4 cup water</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather your ingredients: 2 cups mixed berries (such as strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries), 1/4 cup sugar, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>Wash and prepare the berries. Hull and slice the strawberries if using.</li>
        <li>In a medium saucepan, combine the berries, sugar, and lemon juice.</li>
        <li>Heat the mixture over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves and the berries start to release their juices, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once the mixture comes to a simmer, reduce the heat to low. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the berries are soft and the compote has thickened slightly, about 10-15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>Allow the compote to cool slightly before serving. It can be served warm or at room temperature.</li>
        <li>Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week. Reheat gently before serving if desired.</li>
    </ol>
